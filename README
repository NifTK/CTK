Introduction
============

The Common Toolkit is a community effort to provide support code for medical image analysis,
surgical navigation, and related projects.

See http://commontk.org

This repository is a version of CTK, as used by the NifTK project.

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/commontk/CTK.


Updating the master branch
==========================

The master branch should exactly match the CTK master. We update
a local branch here, just so we have a reference of which commit
we think we have merged up to.

So:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/commontk/CTK
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master


Updating the niftk branch
=========================

git checkout niftk
git merge --no-ff master

(and try to put something useful in the commit message)


Differences between niftk branch and master branch
==================================================

The NifTK project aims to have as few differences as possible between
this version of CTK and the original CTK. All bugfixes should be 
raised in the CTK issue tracker on GitHub and then a branch
created here, forking from **master** and using the branch naming convention

<CTK issue number>-description

for example

409-widgets-on-ctkPopupWidget-do-not-get-keyboard-focus

After fixing the bug it can be pushed to the upstream by

git push upstream 409-widgets-on-ctkPopupWidget-do-not-get-keyboard-focus

and you can send a pull request through the GitHub web interface.
CTK can then merge the bugfix into their code, and we pick up the fix
when we update our master branch, and consequently merge into the
niftk branch.

There are however cases where the NifTK project requires functional differences.
Again, these should be as few as possible.  In this case there may or may not
be a bug report raised with CTK, so the branch naming convention should
either be the same as the above, or just

trac-<trac ticket number>-description 

These functional differences should still be forked from master so that if CTK 
want to merge it back to their code-base, they can. We would however immediately
merge it into the niftk branch once testing was complete.

If you cannot wait until a fix is merged to the upstream then you can
also create a branch with the trac ticket number, cherry pick the commits
from the branch of the pull request, and update this README file to keep
track of the differences.
